Description:
1click / Windows Builder - Sponsored by kind people that makes you go Pro. Only run 1click.cmd if Windows Builder failed, which if that happens run Windows Builder first, then run 1click, then Windows Builer again.
Practical Explorer - Windows 11 removed a lot of shortcuts like "Delete Permenantly" in File Explorer, 
                     this makes the UI back to what it was in Windows 10, 
                     also "Show More Options" on Right click by default.

Why I wrote some of the scripts and what I want to say:
OK, lets be straight here, WINDOWS 11 SUCKS. MICROSOFT WHY WOULD YOU REMOVE SO MANY USEFUL SHORTCUTS/BUTTONS
EVERYONE USE? YOU ARE MAKING MY LIFE SO MUCH HARDER AS A STUDENT BECAUSE I HAVE TO CLICK MY MOUSE A FEW MORE
TIMES TO "DO ACTIONS" ON MY FILES IN FILE EXPLORER. MICROSOFT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN USE WINDOWS YOURSELF.
OR ELSE WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THINGS SO MUCH HARDER. I ALSO HATE THAT YOU HAVE TO CLICK "ALL APPS" TO SHOW ALL APPS
IN START, WINDOWS 10'S START MENU WAS PERFECT IF YOU CUSTOMIZED IT CORRECTLY, WINDOWS 11'S START MENU SUCKS, WHO WOULD
PIN APPS WHEN YOU CAN SEARCH THEM UP? SHOWING ALL APPS BY DEFAULT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE 
AS USERS WOULD SEARCH APPS WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK, BUT BROWSE APP LIST WHEN THEY ARE CHILLING, clicking twice for pinned apps
is so slow compared to searching with a recommended pop up...
ALSO WHY THE STUPID ROUND CORNER? SUCH INPRACTICAL SPACE WASTE. WINDOWS 11 IS NOT FOR WORKERS, ITS FOR A STUPID
FASHION SHOW, LIKE WEARING A TOILET PAPER DRESS BECAUSE IT LOOKS NICE BUT CAN'T BE DRESSED IN THE PUBLIC...
WHY MICROSOFT? Everyone hates Windows 11 BECAUSE OF THESE reasons and there are so much more.
However I do have to say Windows 11 improved a few apps like "Settings" with the context menu and a few improvements.
Keep up the good work Microsoft? I hate and love you.
