How to use Tutorial:

1) Download
1. Click the Green "Code" button then click "Download as ZIP".

2) Extracting
2. After Downloaded, "Computer-Trusted-Tools---Optimizing-Cleaning-Security-Reviews.zip" will show in your download folder, click "Extract here" and "Computer-Trusted-Tools---Optimizing-Cleaning-Security-Reviews" folder will be shown in your "Download Folder".

3) Using
3. Open the folder "Computer-Trusted...", then open "TOOLS (DOWNLOAD FOR REGULAR USERS)" folder, and the Tools are inside. According to your needs, run the one you want as Admin. "This PC Optimizer.cmd" is for freeing space occupied by junk, defragging and speeding up PC; "File and Network Viewer" is for viewing network connections, installed apps and packages.

Remarks:
1. Please Edit the scripts according to your needs, "This PC Optimizer" might delete data needed for 1% developers, you may also remove :: behind lines that you would want to run. Those lines are disabled by default as deleting them may cause problems to Windows and apps. "Network and File Viewer" is 100% safe to use, as it will not delete anything, but generate a new folder to store reports, in "C:\File and Network Reports - DELETABLE".
2. Detailed information about the scripts are shown at the start of the scripts.

This PC Optimizer:
RUN AS ADMIN!
Steps:
1. Auto end tasks (#Caution! DON'T CLOSE TOOL HERE) 2. Disk Cleanup 3. Network Flush
4. Disable space wasting features (#Caution! See if you like using them)
5. Reveal Hidden Files 6. Clear Temp, logs, Crashdumps,
System Event logs, Diagnosis logs, Reports, History of virus scanner etc
6. Cache (#Caution! Check your tools, like do you use inetpub?)
Please edit the script according to your needs. Especially paths with #Caution!
Keeping it organized will help a lot.
Rebooting twice after using is recommended, to let CACHE regenerate and prevent errors,
However the author has made sure they will and prevented deleting most cache (you can enable them)
Some Cache store your personal settings that's why the author don't want to mess with them.
Enabling some has crashed 20 Virtual Machines and 5 Contributers' computers
(Require user to manually check file paths, espescially CACHE, which might store personalization settings)
(Most cache that has been disabled are safe to enable for general users)

Remarks (seriously)
Despite being safe to use, as noted, please do edit "This PC Optimizer" according to your needs, default setup may remove files used by 1% developers, such as inetpub which isn't commonly used for web development. This isn't an requirement, but "This PC Optimizer" has a "Task killer", which ends all tasks, so restarting your PC 1-2 times after using is recommended to reopen required background programs. Please do not end "Task Killer" while it is running especially if you are using "Developer Edition or Beta Edition of Windows", as there will be a 4% chance that your taskbar will be broken even after restart, this has been tested on 200 Virtual Machines running Windows 11 Dev. For general Windows users a restart or just waiting for the taskbar to reappear seems to fix the problem.
